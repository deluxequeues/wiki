## Reporting Bugs & Issues

We all know bugs are never fun. DeluxeQueues is a fairly big plugin so we ask that if you experience a bug or an issue to please confirm that it is actually caused by us and not by other plugin that might be conflicting with it.

If you have confirmed that there is a bug and would like to report it, you may do so by filling out a report [here](https://github.com/deluxequeues/DeluxeQueues/issues)
